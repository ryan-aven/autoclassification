This is a simple Machine Learning project trying to predict EDA program type using the project description. The data used were an extract of grant awards made by the Economic Development Administration throughout Fiscal Fear 2020 (a data set of approximately 1400 rows).

The initial model was a simple univariate regression using Random Forest Classification TF-IDF weighting vectors, and had an accuracy rate of 91%. Enhancements/additional refinements to the model enabled it to reach 92% accuracy.
